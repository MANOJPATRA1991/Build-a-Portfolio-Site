  2. Once done, open the project in your favorite IDE and run `npm install` in command prompt on Windows to install the node dependencies as specified in the **package.json** file. The various dependencied involved are:
  
      ```
        "devDependencies": {
          "grunt": "~0.4.5",
          "grunt-contrib-jshint": "~0.10.0",
          "grunt-contrib-nodeunit": "~0.4.1",
          "grunt-contrib-uglify": "~0.5.0",
          "grunt-contrib-clean": "~0.6.0",
          "grunt-mkdir": "~0.1.2",
          "grunt-contrib-copy": "~0.8.0"
        },
        "dependencies": {
          "grunt-responsive-images": "^0.1.6"
        }
      ```
  
  3. Then install [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php) for respective OS.
  
  4. Once installed, run `grunt` from the command prompt while within the project directory to create responsive images for the web site. This will create a new folder **images** which will hold images with different size and density.
  
  5. Now open in the **index.html** file in your favorite browser to view the project.
  
 > To debug in Android: 
      1. connect your device via USB to your computer. 
      2. Then enable USB Debugging on the device and run `adb start-server` from command prompt on computer. 
      3. Now move to Chrome (if you want to use other browsers, make sure to check how to debug through their documentation) and type `chrome://inspect` in the address bar. Then set **Port** and **IP Address and port** in Port Forwarding settings.
      4. Now install [simplehttpserver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simplehttpserver) by running the command `npm install simplehttpserver -g` from the command prompt. Once installed run `simplehttpserver <path-to-project-directory` which will start up the server thus, enabling us to debug on Android devices.
